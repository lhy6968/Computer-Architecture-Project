# Computer-Architecture-Project
# Project1
The first project is to write an assembler for MIPS assembly language. Basically, my program takes an input of MIPS assembly language file, assembles it, then generates a 
simple output file which is “executable”.
# Project2
Project2 is called a MIPS Simulator, in which I will take a MIPS code input and simulate executing the 
code. For example, if an adder MIPS code is given to me, my first program should translate it 
into a binary code file, and my second program should prompt the user to enter two integers 
and output the correct answer.
# Project3
In this project, I use verilog to complete ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit). I implement a lot of ALU operations like add, addi, addu, addiu, sub, subu, mult, multu, div, divu, and, andi, nor, or, ori, xor, xori and so on.
# Project4
In this project, I deal with a pipeline processor which can execute 
MIPS instructions with verilog. Compared with Project 3, I design a whole 
CPU module, including the clock, instruction memory, registers, ALU, data memory and 
control unit. I define the MIPS instruction and build the data path in a verilog 
file and test the MIPS instructions in the test file, then display the result like Project 3.
